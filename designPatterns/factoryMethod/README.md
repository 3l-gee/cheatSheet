### Factory Method

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

# Real World Analogy

- A blacksmith crafts Weapons
- The weapons are Axes and Swords
- All the weapons must be :
    - Forged
    - Sharpend

Making a sword or an axe uses the same tools and process, but with different parameters.
The blacksmith could easily start making spears, the tools are already implemented (forging / sharpening).
On the other hand, it wount be easy to start making bows, as he doens't have the tool to build them.

# Problem

- How to structure 

# Why Factory Method ?
